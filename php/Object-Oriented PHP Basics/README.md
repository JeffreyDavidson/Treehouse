# Object-Oriented PHP Basics

This class introduced into object oriented programming with the PHP language. I am learning how to take my procedural code and turn it into object oriented code. Doing this is showing me how to look at everything as an object and how objects have properties and methods.

The following is a list of concepts I was introduced and understand from this class.

* Classes
* Objects
* Properties
* Methods
* Magic Methods
* Magic Constants
* Access Modifiers
* Collection Objects
* Filtering
* Single Responsibility Principle
* DRY
* KISS
